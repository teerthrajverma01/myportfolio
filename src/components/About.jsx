          Hello, I am a Frontend Developer who can develop web applications and
          pages using up-to-date technologies. I develop web applications using
          the React.JS library of the JavaScript programming language and
          related technologies. I am proficient in using Next.JS, Git, React
          Router, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS. My passion is to create modern
          and user-friendly websites and applications. A
          user-experience-oriented approach is very important to me, and for
          this reason, I always take care to stick to this principle in the
          projects I develop. In addition, I continue my education on other
          technologies such as Jest.JS, FastAPI, GraphQL, React Query, Formik,
          React Hook Form, React Native, Express.JS, TypeScript, and MongoDB. I
          am constantly researching new tools and techniques to make the
          development process more efficient using these technologies. I look
          forward to working with you with my experience, skills and passion.
